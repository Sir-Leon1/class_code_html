        <u><h1>The History Of Chuka University<br></h1></u>
        <font type="georgia" size="4">
        The establishment of Chuka University was foretold way back in 1951 by a famous<br>
philanthropist and seer by the name Jerusha Kanyua. She prophesied that an<br>
academic mountain shall sprout at Ndagani. She advised the youth to take a pen<br>
like a spear and a book like a shield.<br>
In 2004, the Egerton University Senate elected Prof. Erastus Njoka to chair a<br>
technical committee that was to among other things, explore the possibility of<br>
putting up a campus in the eastern part of the country. After several consultative<br>
meetings with education stakeholders in Eastern Province and Mount Kenya region,<br>
the Njoka Committee recommended to the University Senate to open a campus at<br>
Chuka due to its central location, a decision that was ratified by the Egerton<br>
University Council on 17th September, 2004<br>
Between September 2004 and August 2005, Egerton University embarked on<br>
renovation of structures within Ndagani educational complex in readiness for the<br>
opening of Egerton University Eastern Campus College (EUECC).Chuka University<br>
College was established through a Legal Notice No. 161 of 2007 as a Constituent<br>
College of Egerton University and the successor of the former Egerton University<br>
Eastern Campus College. The college was officially opened on August l, 2005 and<br>
the then Egerton University Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ezra Maritim appointed Prof. Njoka<br>
as the Director of the new campus college. The Campus College was established<br>
on 27th September, 2004 by Egerton University Council in order to enhance access<br>
to high quality and affordable University education to the people of the Eastern<br>
region and Kenya at large.<br>
